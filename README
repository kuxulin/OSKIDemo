To run in two Docker containers:
- Create an image of existing project (change connectionString in Program.cs to docker one and name it according to docker-compose file in the project)
- pull 2022-latest sql server image
- type this command (in solution directory):
docker-compose up
Here we have two containers, one with sql server, other with our web api
